# StegaMalGuard Pro: Advanced Steganography & Malware Detection Suite #
StegaMalGuard Pro is an advanced tool aimed at detecting steganography and classifying malware in images, using deep learning embedded within an intuitive graphical interface.

*Key Features*
## Steganography Detection: Utilizes various analytical techniques to detect hidden data within images.
## Malware Classification: Classifies images based on malware signatures using a MobileNetV2-based model.
## User-Friendly GUI: Facilitates easy navigation and operation, suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

## Installation

Prerequisites
You will need Python 3.x and either Pip or Conda. Ensure your system meets these requirements.

Dependencies
All necessary dependencies are listed in the environment.yml file, which can be used to create a Conda environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml
Alternatively, dependencies can be installed manually using pip according to the requirements described in the environment file.

## Project Documentation
Detailed project documentation, including methodologies, analyses, and conclusions, is available in the document proiect_Vadana_Ioan_Grigore_334AA.pdf, accessible in the main directory of the project.

## Machine Learning Model
The high_accuracy_malware_model.keras used for malware classification is available in the repository and can be loaded directly for predictions or further training.

# Usage #

Launching the Application
To run the graphical interface:

python steganography.py

Training the Model
To train the model or recalibrate it on new data:

python malware_detection.py

Contributions
Contributions are welcome and appreciated. To contribute, please clone the repository, create a new branch for your proposed changes, and initiate a pull request.

## Disclaimer
The performance of the model depends on the quality and size of the dataset. This script is intended for educational purposes and may require adjustments for production use.
